Overview
========

The tapis-shared-searchlib project generates, compiles and packages the SQL expression language
used in Tapis search filters.  This language is based on the JMS Message expression language used
by Apache ActiveMQ.  We adopted ActiveMQ's JavaCC grammar file and regenerate the parser with, if
necessary, any Tapis customizations that we may need.  The following links provide background
information for our approach.

Usage
=====

After wasting an inordinate amount of time trying to get a single POM file to generate the parser 
source files and then to compile those source files, I decided to go with a 2 step process:

    1. Run pom-generate.xml to generate the parser source code.
    2. Run pom.xml to compile the parser, run tests, and create the JAR.
    
Executing pom-generate.xml creates source files in src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/selector.
These files are saved to the repository as if they were handwritten, which means we only have
to run this POM file when we change the grammar file.  In most environments, this will most 
likely be a MANUAL PROCESS since it occurs so rarely.

Executing pom.xml performs the normal compile-test-jar build phases.  Both the builder class
and the generated parser classes get built each time.

Language Support
================

The original ActiveMQ expression language includes support for built-in and custom functions,
as well as xpath and xquery expressions.  The built-in functions are defined in 
org.apache.activemq.filter.function.BuiltinFunctionRegistry.  These functionss are: REGEX, 
INLIST, MAKELIST, REPLACE and SPLIT.

These capabilities have been removed from the Tapis grammar to maintain strict SQL '92 compliance.
If we decided to add them back in the future, the initial commit contains the code.
